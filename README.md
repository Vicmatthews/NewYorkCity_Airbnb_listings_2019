# NewYorkCity_Airbnb_listings_2019

# OVERVIEW
New york City is a very popular destination for tourists visting the USA. The average tourist would rather prefer to keep the cost of an booking accomodation as moderate as possible. Airbnb therefore provides a platform for such individuals to choose from a vast array of accomodation options available. the focus of this project is to explore the listings provided by the hosts and highlight some interesting insights 

# DATASET
The dataset consist of records of airbnb listings in New York City,2019  which can be can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data

# OBJECTIVE/RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Our task includes highlighting the busiest neighborhoods/hosts, explore the trend in room prices for 2019 and investigate the relationship between number of listings and some factors like review, availability days and minimum nights.
1. Does Manhattan have the highest traffic?
2. Who are the busiest hosts?
3. What insights can we get from the room prices, room availability, reviews. 


# CONCLUSION
At the end of our analysis we see that the location of the properties impacted the rent price. Perhaps, Manhattan is a choice location for toursits, which considerably makes the location more expensive.  Also the busiest hosts have properties across the 5 neighbourhood groups with more readily available rooms. This could be a possible case of abuse of the original intention for the  platform.
